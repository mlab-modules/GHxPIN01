- By design rules: 0.8/0.3 mm (31/12 mils)
- Micro via: yes [0.2/0.1 mm (8/4 mils)]
- Buried/blind via: yes
- Total: 0 (thru: 0 buried/blind: 0 micro: 0)

Outer Annular Ring: 0.3 mm (12 mils)

- By design rules: 0.3 mm (12 mils)

Drill tools (including vias and computing adjusts and rounding):

- 1.1 mm (43 mils) (20)
- 3.1 mm (122 mils) (4)

Solder paste stats:

Using a paste with 87.75 % alloy, that has an specific gravity for the alloy of 7.4 g/cm³
and 1.0 g/cm³ for the flux. This paste has an specific gravity of  4.15 g/cm³.

The stencil thickness is  0.12 mm.

| Side   | Pads with paste | Area [mm²] | Paste [g] |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| Total  |              12 |      15.27 |      0.08 |

Note: this is just an approximation to the theoretical value. Margins of the solder mask and waste aren't computed.
