## What is it?
The GH4PIN01 Module is a 4-pin adapter that converts JST-GH connectors, commonly used in Pixhawk avionics, to standard pin headers. This module includes two JST-GH connectors and supports I2C or CAN bus communication, making it a versatile and essential component in the MLAB system for integrating various electronic devices.

## Why did you make it?
We developed the GH4PIN01 Module to address the need for a reliable and straightforward adapter that bridges JST-GH connectors in Pixhawk avionics with standard pin headers. This allows for easy integration of drone Pixhawk components into MLAB electronic projects, facilitating seamless communication via I2C or CAN bus without the hassle of custom wiring.

## What makes it special?
- **Dual JST-GH Connectors**: Equipped with two JST-GH connectors, this module provides increased connectivity options.
- **I2C and CAN Bus Support**: The 4-pin configuration is ideal for I2C and CAN bus applications, enhancing the module's versatility.
- **MLAB I2C Standard**: The pin header follows the MLAB I2C standard (GND, SDA, +5V, SCL, GND), ensuring symmetrical connections that prevent device damage even if the cable is reversed.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simplifies the process of connecting JST-GH devices to standard pin headers, reducing the need for complex modifications.
- **High Compatibility**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with MLAB modular components and other electronics using standard pin headers.
- **Durable Construction**: Made with high-quality materials to ensure robust and reliable connections suitable for demanding applications.
